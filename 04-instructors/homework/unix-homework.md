# Unix Shell Homework
```
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"

##### Expectations
The goal of this homework is to provide students with an opportunity to practice what they have learned in each class. This practice aids in content retention and preparation for upcoming classes.

Since each class builds upon the previous one, reviewing and familiarizing yourself with the content is crucial due to the limited time for comprehensive in-class reviews

##### Potential Commands

- current directory `pwd`
