##### Why Should We Care About Ethics in Data Science?

##### Os Keyes: 'Counting the Countless'
> Trans lives are ultimately about autonomy: the freedom to set one's own path. Society isn’t a tremendous fan of this.

---
> ..."administrative violence" refers to how administrative systems, like the law—operated by the state's white supremacist capitalist patriarchy—"create narrow categories of gender and force people into them in order to get their basic needs met."

---
> 'Data violence' is the perpetuation of violence through data systems, including YouTube’s recommender algorithm, facial recognition, and online advertising.

How do data science practices exclude people or communities?

---

- Normalizing and Standardizing
    - Open text boxes create data that is difficult to clean

    - A quantitative approach forces us to make buckets and decide the definitions of gender and constrains people's decisions to those buckets
- Consistency
    - Big data encourages us to collect as much data as possible in a standardized way

    - Developing a data history means that variation from the previously determined standardized approach complicates data collection thus is discouraged

Insurance companies are making decisions based on health data (ex. food you buy, exercise, etc.)
<br>

How might this practice exclude people or communities?

Is this practice ethically responsible?

##### Kieran Healy: The Kitchen Counter Observatory
>  Numbers and measures are crude; they pick up the wrong things; they strip out the meaning of what’s happening to real people; they make it easy to ignore what can’t be counted. There’s something to those complaints. But it’s mostly a lazy critique. In practice, I find that far from distancing you from questions of meaning, quantitative data forces you to confront them.

---

Does the reductionist approach of data science simplify complex realities, or does it compel confrontation with them, as Healy suggests?

---

##### Reforming Data Science
> With administrative violence, Spade notes how “reform” often benefits only the least marginalized while legitimizing the system and giving cover for it to continue its violence.

We can see this in facial recognition where people of colour are not well recognized by the program, yet creating a better algorithm only benefits systems of control.

---



Can you identify a product, algorithm, or program that further marginalizes communities?

Do you believe data science can be reformed?
